# JBProject
This Project is entirely the work of Jonathan Brown.
I am helping with the installation and hosting of it.
I am going through the learning curve of installation and using a Raspberry pi as the server.
I am trying to create an installation script to start from a Noobs Pi to being able to host Jonathan's Python Script.
